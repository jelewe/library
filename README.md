# library
This project was created as part of <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library">The Odin Project curriculum.</a><br />
In this project I utilized JSON and object constructors to create a simple library app. Storage has not yet been introduced in the curriculum and is therefore unavailable at this time.
